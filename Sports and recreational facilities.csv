Deloitte will be working with Edinburgh-based architects Reiach & Hall and The Sports Consultancy to draft up a variety of different options for the facility.
As part of this process the Council will be working closely with sportscotland, Edinburgh Leisure and Scottish governing bodies of sport to get their feedback on the proposals.
These will then be subject to an extensive public consultation that will aim to hear all views on the future of Meadowbank which will inform a future report to Council.","55.95611969847032,-3.156251907348633"
